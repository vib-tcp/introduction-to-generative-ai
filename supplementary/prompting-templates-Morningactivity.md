Your role as **[DEFINE ROLE]** is to create **[DEFINE OUTPUT]** to **[AUDIENCE]** to **[GOAL]**. Your responsibilities will include **[DETAILED GOALS]**. **[SUMMARIZED GOAL]**.

***Example:***
Your role as a coding tutor is to create personalized study plans to help first year university students learn how to code in the Python language.

Now, ask 'why?' this **[PROBLEM, CHALLENGE]** exists. ***OR*** Now, ask 'why?' **[WE WANT TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL]**.

Repeat the question 'why?' four more times, digging deeper into each layer to uncover the root cause. Summarize your findings and suggest potential solutions.

***Example 2:***
Act like a Root Cause Analyst. Begin by identifying the problem related to [topic]. Now, ask 'why?' this problem exists. Repeat the question 'why?' four more times, digging deeper into each layer to uncover the root cause. Summarize your findings and suggest potential solutions.

#### 4.3 TEMPLATE (WWW - identify Why, Who and What ):

We would like to write about **[TOPIC]**. For this we would like to brainstorm with you.

To do this we would like you to ask us questions to clarify the WHY this **[PROJECT/CHANGES/PLAN]** should be done and WHO it should be done for. We would like you to ask **[X QUESTOINS]** at a time, brainstorm for us **[X REASONS]** or **[X  SOLUTIONS]** and **[X TYPES OF APPROACHES]**. wait for our answer which you include in the description of the **[PROJECT/PLAN/REQUEST]** that you provide us with. Then we redo the whole circle again. Here is the information about the **[PROJECT/PLAN/REQUEST]**: **[INFO]**

***Example 3:***
We would like to write about [topic]. For this we would like to brainstorm with you.
To do this we would like you to ask us questions to clarify the why this project should be done and who it should be done for, who are the stakeholders. We would like you to ask four questions at a time, brainstorm for us two reasons and two types of stakeholders and wait for our answer which you include in the description of the project that you provide us with.

## 6. PROMPT A PROMPT

#### TEMPLATE (Prompt this whole TEXT at once:):

- You must use the whole text below in one prompt, at once.

I want you to become my expert in creating prompts. The goal is to help me create the most effective prompts that can be used with **[AI TOOL]**. The generated prompt should be phrased in the first person (I) as if I were directly requesting a response. Your response will be in the following format:

Prompt:
{Provide the best possible prompt according to my request. There are no restrictions on the length of the prompt. Use your knowledge of prompt creation techniques to design an expert prompt. Do not assume any details, we will add to the prompt as we go along. Formulate the prompt as a request to receive a response from **[AI TOOL]**. An example would be "You will act as an expert in physics to explain the nature of the universe to me...". Highlight this section with '>' markdown formatting. Do not add any additional quotation marks}.

Possible additions:
{Create three possible additions that can be incorporated directly into the prompt. These should be additions to expand the details of the prompt. The options will be very precise and listed with capital letters. Always update with new additions after each answer}.

Questions:
{Formulate **[X questions]** that seek additional information from me to further refine the prompt. If certain areas of the prompt require further detail or clarity, use these questions to get the necessary information. It is not required that I answer all questions}.

Instructions:
After the Prompt, Possible Additions, and Questions sections have been generated, I will respond to the questions with my chosen additions and answers. Integrate my answers directly into the formulation of the prompt in the next iteration. Please make sure that you don't lose elements of the previous version of the prompt and particularly that you don't change present elements of the previous prompt. The new additions should be added into the prompt.Only modify and change elements of the previous prompt if the user explicitly asks for changes. We will continue this iterative process as I provide you with additional information and you update the prompt until the prompt is perfected. Be imaginative and thoughtful when creating the prompt. At the end of each answer, give precise instructions for the next steps.

Before we start the process, greet me first and ask me what the prompt should be about. Don't show the sections in that first answer.
