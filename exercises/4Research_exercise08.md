Upload the graphical abstract of this paper.

Prompt:

I am working on a scientific graphical abstract and need your expertise as a senior scientist with extensive experience in enhancing the intuitiveness of such visuals. Begin by providing an initial assessment of the current strengths and weaknesses of the graphical abstract. Then ask me which specific elements of the schematic I am most concerned about improving. Then, Analyze the layout and offer step-by-step guidance on how to optimize the positioning of objects, visual clustering of related elements, and separation of unrelated elements. Provide specific advice on creating a visual storyline that efficiently communicates the scientific message from start to finish. Consider the use of colors to link related data and differentiate distinct data groups. I will upload the schematic; ensure your suggestions are tailored precisely to it and avoid generic advice. Guide me through each step, focusing on meta-level improvements to ensure the message is as clear as possible. Please take a deep breath, think deeply and intensely and do this step by step.
