Formulate an active title for your grant, your figure, your slide

Prompt:

Please come up with five different titles for the project. Please consider the audience and make the titles in the structure of "SUBJECT VERB OBJECT". The subject should be the most important element of the project, something that is unique to this project. The verb should be in ACTIVE form, i.e. the title should be a statement, and be as specific as possible. Please provide five titles that are as diverse as possible so that we have a range to choose from.

1. Express only one idea or subject in your title.
2. Put an important word first in the title.
3. The title should be a statement, i.e. include a verb.
4. A title should be the fewest possible words that accurately describe the content of the paper (the recommended length is 10 - 12 words).
5. Use simple word orders and common word combinations.
6. Be as descriptive as possible and use specific rather than general terms (specific drug name rather than just the class of drug).
7. Write names in full, avoid using abbreviations and acronyms.
8. Use key words which highlight the main content of your manuscript and can be understood, indexed, and retrieved by a database search.

Short description of the project follows.
